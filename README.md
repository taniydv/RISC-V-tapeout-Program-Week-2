# RISC-V-tapeout-Program-Week-2

Forwarding to the RISC-V , Lets's move to the WEEK 2 titled as "BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling". Week 2 is a research week whose objective is to build solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tool  (Icarus verilog & GTKWave).

### Fundamentals of SoC
System on Chip (SoC) integrates a complete electronic system including processors, memory and peripherals onto a single silicon chip to reduce size, cost and power consumption. SoCs are highly specialized and now are being developed for specific applications such as enchancing machine learning, advanced AI capabilities and high-performance cloud computing with faster data processing.

### Components of SoC

* Multiple Cores: A processor with multiple cores in the form of a microcontroller, microprocessor, digital signal processor, or application-specific instruction set processor.
  
*Memory Capabilities: Memory capabilities such as RAM, ROM, FLASH, EEPROM, and/or cache memory.

*External Interfaces: External interfaces for wired communication protocols such as HDMI, USB4, FireWire, USART, SPI, IÂ²C, or Ethernet.

*Wireless Capabilities: Wireless capabilities such as WiFi or Bluetooth and other radio frequency capabilities.

*GPU: A Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) for accelerating specific tasks and to visualize the interface.

*Voltage Regulation: Voltage regulators, phase lock loop (PLL) control systems, built-in oscillators, timers, and analog-to-digital (ADC) converters.

*Intrachip Communication: Intrachip communication subsystems for connecting individual circuit blocks, such as Interface busses or newer intercommunication networks known as networks-on-chip (NoC).

*Signal Processing: Digital, analog, and mixed-signal processing circuit blocks for any sensors, actuators, data collection, and data analysis.
